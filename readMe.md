### About Addon

The content in the `fret_dance_addon` folder is a Blender add-on. To use it, compress the entire folder into a zip file, then locate and install this zip file through Blender's add-on installation interface.

The add-on is designed to assist with the initialization setup process for character models.

### Note to English Readers:

Due to the extensive documentation content, I recommend viewing my Zhihu Column for complete information.

As the author is not a native English speaker, this README may contain machine-translated text. For better understanding, I suggest English readers:

1. Visit my Zhihu Column
2. Use browser translation plugins for optimal reading experience

The automatic translation from Chinese to English typically provides more accurate results than my direct machine translation here.
